# advent-of-clj

Using https://adventofcode.com/2018/ as an excuse and motivation to explore Clojure.

This is a learning project, the code is very rough but hopefully improving as time goes on.

## Usage

The project main function should be run with an argument for which day/level to solve. 1a runs day 1 problem 1, 3b day 3 problem 2 etc. There are two problems per day.
